# spring-school
A single project using Spring Framework

This api project is for study purposes only. 
It makes use of simple authentication with login and password. 
Implements data persistence with DataJpa, making use of validation on fields with Spring notations and custom error handling.
It is still incomplete, I will continue to update the project accordingly to gain knowledge.
